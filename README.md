Description of the project: Microbial communities are at the heart of most biogeochemical processes on Earth, empowered by the astounding diversity of their functional traits. However, a comprehensive framework to address the functional responses of microbial communities
to environmental change is still lacking.  Through the integration of theoretical ecology with large-scale genome-resolved metagenomics, we have generated a systematic overview of the diversity of bacterial functional profiles. Upon the evaluation of major categories of
functional traits, we found higher dissimilarity among genomes in traits related to the interaction with the environment than in traits tied to basic functions like DNA replication and translation. Additionally, this distinct pattern across functions was modulated by the
microbiome type, highlighting its potential to identify fundamental mechanisms governing functional diversity across habitats, ecosystems, and communities. Interestingly, aquatic microbiomes exhibited higher functional diversity than the other microbiomes. The functional
diversity pattern described in this study offers a universal framework for understanding and model ecosystem-wide dynamics of microbial communities.
